# PB-API
Angular 1.6 sample project with:
  - es6 features(thanks to babel it will be transpiled to es5)
  - webpack + karma + jasmine + protractor + eslint + unit-test coverage report
  - add ngAnotate to webpack to make developers life easy, it will generate anotation for dependency injection automatically just with one 'nginject' command after the line which is needed
## Progressbar with API call(config file). for testing this code or extending it:
  - git clone this repo or download it as a zip file and extract it
  - cd to projetct folder
